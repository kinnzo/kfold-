# kfoldpp: An improved implementation of the Gillespie algorithm

## Introduction
This code is a translation from FORTRAN to C++ originally provided by Eric C. Dykemann. The original version is available at the link below.
```
https://github.com/edykeman/kfold
```
The files have been named exactly as in the original repository. Small improvements include the use of random function provided by C++ to facilitate better pseudo random number generation.

## Work to be done
The main file, kfold.cpp has to be completed to utilize all the other files. The system is not fully integrated and therefore, a few function calls inside some scripts have been commented. This can be easily identified by searching for "//Commenting the function" comment.
